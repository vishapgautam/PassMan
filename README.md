# PassMan
Aim :-> The aim of this project will be to simplify the complex task of managing passwords which include generating strong and random passwords, storing them in a secure manner and providing them when they needed.  

 

Why it’s needed and to whom? 

As of now days people have lots of different accounts from bank to social media, most of them may have more than 20 credentials and that number can go up to 50 for a person working in IT fields. 

Now there are some rules for a password to be secure like it should be atleast 8 word long, should contain different set of characters, should contain no to less noun, and does not include any personal information. 

Now here the problem come if we have to make only 1 or few passwords then we can make It following above rules but as I mentioned now days people can have around 20 to 50 different different credential then how they can make and remember that much unique and complex passwords. 

Here they make some of the biggest security mistakes which leads to loss of information, money, resources and time, which is using a common, simple and a memorable password that they can remembered easily. 

It’s not all the fault of people who make this kind of vulnerable passwords they make it because its easy for them to remember it and unfortunately its also easy to crack it. 

Here is the list of some most commonly used passwords are  --> 

   

1)123456 

2)123456789 

3)iloveyou 

4)qwerty 

5)password 

6)abc123 

7)password1 

8)(some digits of their phone number) 

9)any noun ex. Name, place, religion, movie etc 

10) username itself or some modified username 

These above are some of the most used common passwords that can be cracked within less than 1 millisecond. 

If you provide any information in your password then it will become information or data for someone, that can be dangerous for anyone no matter whom the password belongs, lets take a case like I made a password my birth date 06/09/2001 now if I make this as a password there are few serious security concerns, first is that it can be easily gussed, second is that it itself reveals some information about the user and the third is now the attacker got one more category of password to target others that is birthdate. 

So now to solve all the above problems we are creating an web application that will solve our two big problems first is it will able to generate highly random and complex passwords that will fulfill all the criteria of a strong password, and second is that it can also store your passwords within this webapp securely for your future use. 

User to this webapp will be any person that want to remove all the hustle of remembering different different passwords. 

 

How accessible and handy this it? 

In terms of handiness, this whole webapp can be accessed with just one link anywhere around the world,  using that single link(or website) you can create, see, modify, and delete any of your passwords. Your passwords will be saved securly in a remote database using hashing and encryption. 

  

 

  

Technical Specifications -->  

This webapp is majorily divided into two parts --> 

 Front-end 

 Back-end 

Front-end Part -> It include all the templets like main homepage, login page, user page etc. The front end part is made using the following technologies -> 

    1) HTML 

    2) CSS 

    3) Javascript 

    4) Bootstrap 4 

    5) Embedded Javascript templetes 

 

Back-end Part -> Back-end includes all the functioning of the whole webapps, like routing, controlling, database management, querying, generating passwords, serving web pages, encrypting user details, creating users, creating passwords, authorizing users etc. It include following technologies --> 

   1) NodeJs 

   2) Javascript 

   3) Express 

   4) Mongoose 

   5) MongoDB 

   6) Hashing, and Google OAuth
